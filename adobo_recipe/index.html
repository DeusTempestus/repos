          <h3>What is Chicken Adobo?</h3>
          <p>Chicken Adobo is an authentic Filipino dish and is one of the mostly recognized Filipino foods. Not to be mistaken with Mexican adobo, this dish is uniquely prepared by stewing chicken in vinegar and soy sauce.</p>
          <p>According to several experts in Asian food history, Filipinos were cooking adobo before Spanish colonization. Cooking with vinegar preserves meat, and is one of the earliest food preservation practices. This is also true of pork adobo, which is another popular variation of the dish.</p>

          <p>While there have been several variations of adobo across the years, chicken adobo remains one of the most popular and for good reason! The taste of juicy chicken in a succulent, umami adobo sauce makes chicken adobo a comfort food for all ages. From kids to adults, we can't get enough of this mouthwatering meal!</p>

          <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use any chicken part when cooking Filipino chicken adobo. The common parts that I use are thigh, drumstick, and breast.</li>
            <li>The most important part of cooking chicken adobo is the marinade. The longer you let your chicken marinate in the rich combination of adobo flavors, the tastier it’ll be! I tend to make multiple batches of chicken adobo, so I can cook adobo whenever I feel like it. The longer it stays in the freezer, the more your chicken is able to absorb adobo’s amazing taste.</li>
            <li>Dark Soy Sauce is common when for adobo. However, you may use any kind of soy sauce that you prefer. Using light soy sauce is not bad. Coconut aminos will also work.</li>
            <li>White vinegar is commonly used. Cane vinegar and apple cider vinegar works too.</li>
            <li>Garlic helps make adobo delicious. Use as many garlic as you prefer.</li>
            <li>Onions can also be used for chicken adobo. If this is the case, it will need to be sautéed after pan frying the chicken.</li>
            <li>If you want your chicken to be a lot tenderer before cooking, another option is to cook the chicken in a slow cooker or crockpot overnight. This will enhance the flavors and make the chicken much juicier.</li>
